Lightweight app designed for fast and easy markdown note-taking

</div>

## Motivation 

Markdown note-taking apps are awesome, offering loads of benefits, flexibility, and features. However, most of them can be slow and complicated, making it a hassle to note down a quick two-line note. QuickMark is a lightweight, minimalist Android app designed to be the go-to quick note-taker for markdown users.

With its simple and clean design, QuickMark allows you to take notes from anywhere using the quick tile shortcut, app shortcut, or widget. Got something on your mind? It's just one click away from being in your notes.

I'm a solo developer behind **QuickMark**, and it's been quite a journey evolving this app! I've tackled various projects along the way, but I’m always excited to contribute to the markdown note-taking community.
If you enjoy **QuickMark** and want to see it continue to grow with new features, improvements, and bug fixes, your support would mean the world to me.
